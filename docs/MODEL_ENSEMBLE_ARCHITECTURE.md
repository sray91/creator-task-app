# CoCreate Model Ensemble Architecture

## Overview

The CoCreate system has been transformed from a single-model approach to a sophisticated **Model Ensemble for Quality and Voice** that uses three AI models working in tandem to create high-quality, authentic LinkedIn content.

## Architecture Philosophy

The ensemble approach recognizes that different AI models excel at different tasks:
- **Large document analysis** requires models with extensive context windows
- **Voice analysis and style creation** benefits from models trained on human communication patterns
- **Content generation and quality review** needs models optimized for creative writing and factual accuracy

## Model Ensemble Components

### üß† Model 1: Gemini 2.5 - Style Guide Creation
**Purpose**: Analyze large training documents to create comprehensive style guides

**Capabilities**:
- Process up to 50,000 words of training documents
- Extract voice & tone patterns from extensive content
- Identify writing mechanics and content patterns
- Create structured style guides for LinkedIn optimization

**Use Case**: When users have uploaded training documents (PDFs, Word docs, etc.), Gemini 2.5 analyzes the content to understand their professional writing style, vocabulary preferences, and communication patterns.

### üé® Model 2: Claude 4 Sonnet - Style Preset Creation
**Purpose**: Create reusable style presets from past LinkedIn posts using Claude's Styles API

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze sentence rhythm and flow patterns
- Identify vocabulary and language formality levels
- Extract tone and personality characteristics
- Create structured style presets for voice consistency

**Use Case**: When users have past posts in the `past_posts` table, Claude 4 Sonnet creates detailed style presets that capture their authentic LinkedIn voice, storing these as reusable templates.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Model 3: Claude Sonnet 4 - Draft Generation & Quality Review
**Purpose**: Generate content and perform quality assurance

**Capabilities**:
- Generate authentic content using style guides and presets
- Review factual accuracy and clarity
- Optimize for LinkedIn best practices
- Refine content while preserving voice

**Use Case**: Primary content generation and quality control, ensuring high-quality output that maintains user authenticity.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Document Analysis (Gemini 2.5)
```
IF training_documents.count > 0:
    ‚Üí Gemini 2.5 analyzes documents
    ‚Üí Creates comprehensive style guide
    ‚Üí Stores insights for voice context
ELSE:
    ‚Üí Skip document analysis
```

### Step 2: Voice Preset Creation (Claude 4 Sonnet)
```
IF past_posts.count > 0:
    ‚Üí Claude 4 Sonnet analyzes posts
    ‚Üí Creates style preset via Styles API
    ‚Üí Saves to user_style_presets table
ELSE:
    ‚Üí Use fallback pattern analysis
```

### Step 3: Content Generation (Claude Sonnet 4)
```
‚Üí Combine style guide + style preset + user request
‚Üí Generate draft with voice preservation
‚Üí Return content with ensemble metadata
```

### Step 4: Quality Review (Claude Sonnet 4)
```
‚Üí Review draft for accuracy and clarity
‚Üí Check LinkedIn best practices compliance
‚Üí Refine if needed while preserving voice
‚Üí Return final content with quality score
```

## Database Schema

### User Style Presets Table
```sql
user_style_presets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    preset_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    style_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    source_model TEXT DEFAULT 'Claude 4 Sonnet',
    source_posts_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Style Data Structure
```json
{
    "analysis": "Detailed voice analysis from Claude",
    "source_posts_count": 15,
    "created_with": "Claude 4 Sonnet",
    "sentence_rhythm": {...},
    "vocabulary_patterns": {...},
    "tone_characteristics": {...},
    "structural_patterns": {...}
}
```

## API Integration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Existing
OPENAI_COCREATE_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# New for Model Ensemble
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Assistant response",
    "updatedPost": "Generated content",
    "isSignificantUpdate": true,
    "processingSteps": [...],
    "voiceAnalysis": {...},
    "trendingInsights": {...},
    "ensembleDetails": {
        "modelsUsed": ["Gemini 2.5", "Claude 4 Sonnet", "Claude Sonnet 4"],
        "styleGuide": {...},
        "stylePreset": {...},
        "draftGeneration": {...},
        "qualityReview": {...}
    }
}
```

## Fallback Strategy

The ensemble includes robust fallback mechanisms:

1. **Model Unavailability**: If any ensemble model is unavailable, the system falls back to the next available model or ultimately to GPT-4o
2. **API Failures**: Each model call is wrapped in try-catch with specific error handling
3. **Rate Limits**: Automatic detection and graceful degradation when APIs are rate-limited
4. **Data Availability**: System adapts when training documents or past posts are not available

## Performance Optimizations

### Document Limitations
- Maximum 5 training documents per request
- Documents limited to 10,000 words each
- Total word limit of 50,000 across all documents

### Caching Strategy
- Style presets are cached in the database
- Reused across sessions to avoid re-analysis
- Updated only when new posts are added

### Processing Steps
Real-time feedback shows users which models are active:
- "üß† Gemini 2.5: Analyzing training documents..."
- "üé® Claude 4 Sonnet: Creating style preset..."
- "‚úçÔ∏è Claude Sonnet 4: Generating draft..."
- "üîç Claude Sonnet 4: Quality review..."
